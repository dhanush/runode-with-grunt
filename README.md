runode-with-grunt
=================

This project uses grunt to clone a git repo of any basic nodejs project and then run it.  

To get started edit the config.json file and enter the git url which you want to clone.

Then run 


    npm install 
	grunt


You can see your app running. 


*Note:* The default code uses [hour-glass](https://github.com/dhanush/hour-glass) project as the source git url. It has a dependency on MongoDB application, hence you need MongoDB up and running to test it completely
